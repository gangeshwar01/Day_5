## ⚙️ Environment Setup

We recommend using a virtual environment and Jupyter Lab or VS Code for notebooks.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install core packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Example `requirements.txt`:
```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scipy
statsmodels
nltk
streamlit
plotly
numba
```
